# NNotes: A graph-based note-taking app with directional, typed links and powerful queries.

nnotes is a graph-powered note system inspired by Obsidian, but with a focus on meaningful connections. Notes can be linked with directional, tagged edges, making it easy to model relationships, run queries, and visualize how changes ripple through your knowledge. Whether youâ€™re writing a novel, mapping research, or modeling complex systems, nnotes lets you think in networks instead of folders.
